# Voice_to_Text
Voice to Text is a full-stack web application that converts spoken audio into accurate text in real-time. Built with a modern frontend and backend stack, the app uses speech recognition APIs to process voice input through the browser or uploaded audio files, then provides and stores the transcribed text for further use.
